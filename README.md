## Tools

Project Org Tool : [Trello](https://www.trello.com)  
Framework : [Angular](https://angular.io/start)

## Tasks

Barbara - Information Component  
Markus - Product Component  
Mattias - News Component  
Laszlo - HTML & CSS & Organisation  

We use Trello as a Project Organisation, and Angular as a Framework for better structure.  
With Angular we organized the project so, that we have 3 components, so everyone can work on one component, without merging problems.
